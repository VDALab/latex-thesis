The comments from the committees in the defense are list as follows. We answer these questions and also make improvement in the corresponding manuscript.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In Chapter~\ref{chap:Method}, to search the performance space, power and area should be always concerned as the minimized criteria. \\
  {\bf Answer:} Originally, power consumption is one of the performance metrics to explore. However it is practical to only minimize the performance dissipation and area for chip in the advanced technology node. We add these criteria as constraints in the optimization equation in the future works.
