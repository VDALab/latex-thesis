  This paper introduces a novel methodology for fast analog layout migration.
  The layout extraction and preservation is proposed to preserve placement and routing behavior with hierarchy and symmetry constraints.
  Based on the layout preservation, multiple layout solutions are efficiently generated by our migration with flexibility. A methodology for wire segment refinement is also delivered for better performance after migration.
  We validate the proposed method on a variable-gain amplifier, a folded cascode OpAmp and a low drop-out regulator.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our approach has the capability of preserving analog layout behavior of the reference layout. Moreover, the strategy with multiple placements generation and preserved routing provide better layout solution than previous approaches. The proposed migration flow generates layouts that have comparable performance with manual layout and state-of-the-art. In this way, our proposed work guarantees the routing reusability with at least 75\% completeness on wirelength and 80\% on wire segments of reconstructed routing and the productivity with at least 5 times speedup over manual layout.
